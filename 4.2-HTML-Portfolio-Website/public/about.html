<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings! I'm Shubham Kumar Gupta, a dedicated web developer fueled by curiosity and a desire to craft seamless online experiences.</p>

<p>  My journey began with a fascination for coding, which evolved into a passion for front-end and back-end development.</p>

<p>  I specialize in creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly websites that not only look great but also function flawlessly.</p>

<p>  When I'm not immersed in lines of code, I'm an avid cyclist, a sci-fi enthusiast, and a cold coffee lover.</p>

<p>  Let's work together to build digital solutions that make a difference.</p>
